# TODO
# Line chart with average stored energy ((puffer oben + puffer unten) / 2) fan'd out to 50% on each site.
# Line color green or yellow (just try). fan color just a lighter, more translucent color.
# By default hidden but optionally displayed: The actual puffer oben and puffer unten values with red (or orange) and blue lines.
# Legend maybe above?
# Additionally, display a lower and upper threshold with a dashed or dotted line (in black?) but make sure it's not the same
# as the cursor indicator line.
# If you have enough time add a water buffer tank to the right of it with red at the top phasing out downwards
# and blue at the bottom phasing out upwards with either the respective low/high values or the average value in the center.
# The whole thing should be zoomable and panable
# Data is selected with a time selector
# Last week or 5 days by default
# Then another chart with the same lower and upper threshold and the same time selection, which just shows a line for the
# boiler temp. These thresholds should be configurable just like the time selection.

# Notes:
# - In summer the boiler is important, in winter the buffer
# - The dashboard is meant for current data and supposed to assist in the analytical task of determining the next best
#   point in time for firing up the furnace. Old data may be interesting to look at but not the main purpose of it.
# - the drinking water temperature doesn't make sense, it of course can never be heated above the maximum stored energy
#   (it can stay there longer than the buffer sure but it can't rise above the buffer max!)

# Feedback:
# - Danger zone -> alert (just mention that, in the end this is a dashboard, not an app)
# - Very clear indication to get an instruction without having to analyze the chart -> light signal (and maybe a time estimate)
# - Shift data maybe by 1 year back so you have access to "future" values
# - Compare summer and winter and try to analyze whether or not the the average is even meaningful (in winter)
# - Maybe show the real data by default and have a simplified checkbox instead of a detailed to show the average
#   -> she's concerned that the average of the two points are misleading or not helpful when the real
#      distribution is unknown
# - Maybe figure out which is more important for the decision, buffer max, buffer min or average.
#   -> Dad says the max is (much) more important currently but the average might give interesting insight

# Questions I didnt ask:
# - Visual buffer drawn next to it (probably not helpful or impressive, think we can ignore that)
# - Conversion into kwh or smth like that but what out she's a physicist so it would have to be right and that's hard
