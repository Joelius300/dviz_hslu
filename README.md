# DVIZ HSLU

This is a data visualization project I created using the data from [HeatingDataMonitor](https://github.com/Joelius300/HeatingDataMonitor). \
It's a dashboard to help with decisions around the heating unit.
More information about the project and its implementation can be found in [REPORT.pdf](./REPORT.pdf).

## Run it

To run the project yourself, follow these steps:

- Create and activate a new virtual Python environment with the requirements in `requirements.txt`
- Add the data to `data/` (using `transform-data.py` to prepare it)
- Run `streamlit run main.py`
